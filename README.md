#Gulp-Scaffold
### My Gulp Scaffolding for Projects using gulp-tasks-scaffold + REACT + TSX
#### Also comes with a bash script that will run all npm installs and copy scaffold files to your current directory

---

#### Setup:

1. Clone this Repo
2. Setup and alias that points to the gulp-generator.sh executable file
3. Use alias within any directory via commandline
4. Enjoy never having to setup gulp and installing all the needed npm modules for react + typescript!

**Still Working on being able to use select menus via terminal to help setup projects based on library needs**
